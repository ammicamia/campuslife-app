# CampusLife App
A (mock) mobile application developed in **Android Studio** for an assignment at The University of Waikato. This is a pocket guide for students that contains information about campus facilities, events, clubs, and supports.

## How It's Made:
**Created with:** XML, Java

**NOTE**: This is a prototype built for learning purposes. It was tested on the Pixel 7 emulator (API 24) and may not work as well on other devices.

Since this was a university assignment, a guide was given to us on how to approach the layout and coding. The only constraint we had was that there were no 'if' statements or switch cases when displaying a specific activity, which I left in as I wanted to stay original to the assignment specifications.

## Setup:
To run this project, clone and open on Android Studio.
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ammicamia/campuslife-app.git
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio.
3. Build the project and run it on an emulator.

## Lessons Learned:
This assignment taught me how to start creating Android UIs in Android Studio, as well as handling user interaction through click events. I also learned how to switch between activities using intents, passing extra information in the intents to be parsed and used in another activity, and reading in an XML to be displayed dynamically.
